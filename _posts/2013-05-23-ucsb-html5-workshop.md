I recently hosted a hands-on workshop on HTML5 at UCSB, including a beginner session in the morning and a more advanced session in the afternoon.

The source code for the examples, the slides (built with [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/)), and follow-up answers to questions unanswered during the presentation are available in the [workshop's Github repo](https://github.com/loganfranken/presentations/tree/master/html5-workshop).

Check out the presentation slides and recordings below!
