Last November I gave a workshop on responsive design at UCSB. To be honest, it wasn't one of my better talks: my example project had an inconsistent difficulty curve (we started with some `:after` pseudo element trickery before digging into basic responsive grid layout techniques).

Oh well, every talk is a learning experience, right?

Still, I think we all had a good time and learned a lot. Check out the [slides](http://loganfranken.github.io/presentations/introduction-to-responsive-design/), [video](http://gauchocast.ucsb.edu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer/Default.aspx?id=e13ac51a-666a-4ef4-b8d6-8ddd7029d97b), and [GitHub repository](https://github.com/loganfranken/presentations/tree/master/introduction-to-responsive-design).
