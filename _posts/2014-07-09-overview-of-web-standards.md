Before I left Santa Barbara for Seattle, my fellow Web Standards Group co-chair, David Gurba, and I hosted a workshop introducing staff at the University of California, Santa Barbara campus to web standards.

It was a fun time and we got a lot of great feedback! Special guest speakers included:

- **[Keri Bradford](https://twitter.com/keribradford)**, Marketing, Design, and Social Media Coordinator
- **David Gurba**, web programmer for UCSB Instructional Development Artworks
- **Sam Horowitz**, Chief Information Security Officer
- **Tessa Mendez**, Policy Coordinator
