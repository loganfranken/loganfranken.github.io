Welcome to the **new design!**

With this redesign, I wanted to finally shed Old Habits (small font sizes, fixed widths, meek interface elements) and embrace a bold, minimalist, responsive approach.

If you have a second, let me know what you like and don't like about the new look in the comments.

Here's to a new year and new opportunities!
