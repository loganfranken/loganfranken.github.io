I really enjoyed last year's [Mobility and the Modern Web Conference](http://mmwcon.org/) conference, held at the sprawling University of California, Los Angeles campus.

## The Conference

The main draw of conferences for me is the opportunity to network with my peers and share common experiences. However, I don't always feel I'm learning new things: conference presentations often require a significant amount of preparation and can't keep pace with the speed of new developments in our field. I usually learn a couple new tricks here and there, or see a cool new tool or application I've never seen before, but the benefits of attending a conference are primarily social.

[MMWCon](http://mmwcon.org/), however, was different: whether it was [Jakob Mattsson's](https://twitter.com/jakobmattsson) bleeding-edge work in [automated CSS testing](https://speakerdeck.com/jakobmattsson/automated-css-testing-not-just-a-myth), [Heather Henderson's](https://twitter.com/ladyheatherly) talk on responsive e-mail design (brimming with useful tricks and techniques), or Stanford's [Open Framework](https://openframework.stanford.edu/), there was lot to learn and explore at the conference.

## My Talk

I also gave a talk at the conference on responsive tables and images. Check out the [the slides](http://loganfranken.github.io/presentations/responsive-whales-tables-and-images/). As with most of my talks, I maintain the source code for the slides and a list of notes on the topic in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/loganfranken/presentations/tree/master/responsive-whales-tables-and-images).

This repository has been especially active because of the constant stream of developments in the field of [responsive images](https://github.com/loganfranken/presentations/blob/master/responsive-whales-tables-and-images/Responsive-Images.md). Most notably, the [src-n](http://tabatkins.github.io/specs/respimg/Overview.html) proposal has been making waves since my talk.

## 2014 Conference

I highly encourage you to attend the [MMWCon](http://mmwcon.org/) conference. I'm confident this little conference will build on the momentum from 2013 and present a whole new slew of exciting topics and developments to discover.
