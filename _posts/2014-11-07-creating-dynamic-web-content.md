This week I gave a talk at the University of California, Santa Barbara to a group of Financial Aid professionals across the UC about creating dynamic web content. It was a lot of fun: the talk started with a drawn-out Pac-Man analogy (in the slides below) and ended with an extended Q&A discussion about everything from the use of white space in modern web design to responsive web design (not in the slides, unfortunately).

Here are the slides:
