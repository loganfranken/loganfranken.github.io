I gave a talk on jQuery at the University of California, Santa Barbara with my fellow developer and friend, Jeff Pignataro.

Check out [the slides](http://loganfranken.github.io/presentations/jquery-workshop/), the [GitHub repository with notes and code](https://github.com/loganfranken/presentations/tree/master/jquery-workshop), and the [recording](http://gauchocast.ucsb.edu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer/Default.aspx?id=a5444482-2491-4944-b1cd-7e23a6bcf4e1).
