This year's [UCCSC](https://uccsc.uci.edu/) at UC Irvine was a lot of fun: it's always nice (and reassuring) to hear about the experiences and challenges of those building student systems at the other UCs.

At this conference, I gave two talks:

My first talk was a **case study of a central aid estimator service**, which led into a discussion about **open-source development** within the UC system. You can [listen to the talk](http://replay.uci.edu/clients/uccsc/SB01S_-_Let's_Share_-_A_Financial_Aid_Case_Study_-_MP4_with_Smart_Player_(Large)_-_20130806_09.34.45AM.html) and also [check out the notes and slides on GitHub](https://github.com/loganfranken/presentations/tree/master/lets-share-a-financial-aid-case-study).

My second talk, with Eric Bollens from UCLA, was **an introduction to [WebBlocks](https://github.com/ucla/WebBlocks)**, a responsive toolkit. The [recording of that talk](http://replay.uci.edu/clients/uccsc/LA13.html) is also available, along with the [slides on GitHub](http://ebollens.github.io/WebBlocks-presentations/introduction/).
