The formal publication date of [ECMAScript 6](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript) (the parent standard of the JavaScript language) is [June 2015](http://www.2ality.com/2014/06/es6-schedule.html).

That's less than two months away.

If you're like me, you feel a little behind-the-times: sure, you've read an article or two about the `let` keyword, but the [full list of features](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/) is dizzying. And, before we know it, [ES7](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es7/) will be on the horizon too. Needless to say, I feel a little overwhelmed.

So let's fix that.

Every week day, I'm going to review _one_ ES6 topic. Just one.

This way, instead of locking ourselves in a cabin for a week-long JavaScript sabbatical, we can chip away at this monolithic standard in little pieces each day.
