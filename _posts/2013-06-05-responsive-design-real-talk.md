I had a really wonderful time listening to all of the fantastic minds at the [2013 HighEd Web West conference](http://west.highedweb.org/) at the (beautiful) Chapman University.

If you're interested in viewing my talk on responsive design, you can [check out the slides](http://loganfranken.github.io/presentations/responsive-design-real-talk/), read through the additional notes and resources on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/loganfranken/presentations/tree/master/responsive-design-real-talk), and also peruse [the slides from the other awesome talks](https://speakerdeck.com/highedwebwest/).

Excited for next year!
