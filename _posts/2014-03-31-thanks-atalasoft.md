At my work, we use the [Atalasoft .NET Imaging SDKs](https://www.atalasoft.com/) for an internal document management application. A couple years ago, Atalasoft sent me a free sweatshirt for Christmas, pictured here in this awkward selfie:

This sweatshirt was unlike any other free merchandise I had received from a company: I _loved_ this sweatshirt. The fabric was thin enough to wear around in warmer weather, but thick enough to keep you comfortable, the sleeves were stiff and stayed put when pushed up on my arms, the pockets were roomy, the zipper was sturdy.

It was _quality_ swag.

But, then I lost it: last year, in the commotion of my girlfriend's sister's wedding, I somehow abandoned my favorite sweatshirt. Left it sitting alone somewhere, hanging nervously off the back of some strange chair, waiting expectantly for me to return and retrieve it.

Over the next few months, I resorted back to my old hoodies and jackets: all of them too stuffy and thick and ill-fitting. I missed my imaging SDK-branded friend.

My girlfriend, after listening to the constant complaints and cries over the missing garment, decided to track the sweatshirt down for a Christmas present: she called up Atalasoft Customer Service and asked where she could find a similar jacket.

However, they didn't offer her any direction as to where she could buy a jacket herself: instead, they sent over _three_ jackets (a maroon and blue one for me, and another maroon one for her), two t-shirts, two notebooks, and a couple of books filled with "brain game" puzzles.

It was an awesome Christmas present:

Besides their high-quality merchandise, the Atalasoft .NET SDK and their responsive customer service have been instrumental in helping us wrangle the wildly variant behaviors of the different scanners we use at work.

Beyond all of that, it's really nice to get the reminder from time to time that the companies behind the software components you purchase contain some truly friendly, generous people.

Thanks for everything, Atalasoft!
