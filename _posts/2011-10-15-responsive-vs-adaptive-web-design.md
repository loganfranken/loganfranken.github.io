**Update:** A [recent blog post](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/the-many-faces-of-adaptive-design/) by Brad Frost resurfaced this discussion. In the post, Brad proposes that "adaptive design" refers to the broad approach of creating interfaces that adapt to the needs and capabilities of the User. Responsive design is simply one technique within an adaptive design approach. Of course, this definition conflicts with the definition outlined below; it will be interesting to see how these concepts and their definitions evolve over time.

Here's the quick and dirty difference:

- A **responsive design** fluidly changes to fit any browser size
- An **adaptive design** changes to fit a defined set of browser sizes

## Further Reading

For a little more context and explanation (along with the benefits to either approach), here are some resources on the difference:
