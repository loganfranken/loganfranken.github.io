Last month I was part of an "Introduction to Web Accessibility" workshop at UCSB, along with Adaptive Technology Specialist, Mark Grosch, and a special guest former UCSB student who demoed the JAWS screen reader.

Check out the [slides](http://loganfranken.github.io/presentations/introduction-to-web-accessibility/#/) and [source code](https://github.com/loganfranken/presentations/tree/master/introduction-to-web-accessibility) from my part of the presentation and the [recording](http://gauchocast.ucsb.edu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer/Default.aspx?id=70811e13-15f3-4c56-8299-1cf53b179995) of the entire workshop (excluding, unfortunately, the enlightening JAWS demo).
