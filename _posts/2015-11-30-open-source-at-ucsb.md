Recently, I've been digging a little deeper into the topic of open-source in higher education. To start, I'm trying to gather together examples of what schools are currently doing with open-source.

And, hey, what better place to start than your own alma mater and place of employment? The **University of California, Santa Barbara**.

I compiled together a [full list](https://github.com/loganfranken/ucsb-open-source) of UCSB's open-source presence. Here's a look at a few highlights:

## Interactive Campus Map
