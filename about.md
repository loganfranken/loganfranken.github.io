# About Me

My name is **Logan Franken**.

I'm a **senior engineering lead**. I live in Brooklyn.

I love **making code work for people**. I work as a full-stack
engineer at **[Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/)**, helping people get jobs.

My e-mail is [loganfranken@gmail.com](mailto:loganfranken@gmail.com).
I'm on [itch.io](https://loganfranken.itch.io/),
[GitHub](https://github.com/loganfranken), and
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/loganfranken/).

## Games

In the past few years, I've picked up **indie game development**
as a hobby. I participated in the <a href="https://js13kgames.com/">Js13k games</a>
competition a few times (<a href="https://js13kgames.com/entries/elum" aria-label="2014 Js13k entry">2014</a>,
<a href="https://js13kgames.com/entries/paratec-systems" aria-label="2015 Js13k entry">2015</a>, and
<a href="https://js13kgames.com/entries/control" aria-label="2016 Js13k entry">2016</a>).

Outside of competition, I've released two full games:
**<a href="https://www.loganfranken.com/blog/1582/blackjack/">Blackjack</a>**
and **<a href="https://www.loganfranken.com/blog/1660/dew-drop-swap/">Dew Drop Swap</a>**, 
both games exploring ideas about autonomy and control.

## Projects

To stay fresh, I like to work on fun side projects. Most recently, I worked on a
**<a href="https://github.com/loganfranken/best-buy-rtx-3070" aria-label="Best Buy RTX 3070 Drop Predictor">small React app</a>**
to try and predict when a RTX 3070 would go on sale at Best Buy.

In more consequential work, I was honored to volunteer for **<a href="https://yehawshow.com/">yəhaw̓</a>**,
a groundbreaking Indigenous-centered project series. For the yəhaw̓ website,
I built an <a href="https://github.com/loganfranken/yehaw-map" aria-label="GitHub page for the yəhaw̓ map project">interactive map</a> and
a <a href="https://github.com/loganfranken/yehaw-search" aria-label="GitHub page for the yəhaw̓ search project">search widget</a>.

A recurring focus of my work in the past has been **open-source and higher education**.
One of my favorite projects was an <a href="https://github.com/ucsbfinaid">open-source implementation of the
federal expected family contribution formula</a>. Most of the University of California institutions use these
libraries to power their net price calculators, which prospective students use to estimate the cost of college.

I also tried building out a <a href="https://github.com/universitycommons/">search engine for open-source
higher education projects</a>. It never took off, but it was inspiring to bring together so many wonderful
projects in one place.

## Presentations

Public speaking is a skill I've gradually developed over time: as a junior
developer, I served as the **chair of a Developer Collaboration Group** for
several years within my department at the University of California, Santa Barbara,
hosting trainings and facilitating discussion.

I eventually branched out beyond our department, becoming the
**president of the university Toastmasters group** and the
**chair of the Web Standards Group**, hosting workshops on
<a href="https://www.loganfranken.com/blog/429/introduction-to-responsive-design/" aria-label="UCSB Web Standards Group responsive design workshop">responsive design</a>,
<a href="https://www.loganfranken.com/blog/496/introduction-to-web-accessibility/" aria-label="UCSB Web Standards Group web accessibility workshop">web accessibility</a>,
and <a href="https://www.loganfranken.com/blog/532/overview-of-web-standards/" aria-label="UCSB Web Standards Group web standards workshop">web standards</a>.

Other departments around campus have also asked me to present on
<a href="https://www.loganfranken.com/blog/675/creating-dynamic-web-content/">creating dynamic web content</a>
and <a href="https://www.loganfranken.com/blog/400/creating-responsive-content/">creating responsive content</a>.

Gaining confidence within the university, I finally branched out to talking at conferences,
including <a href="https://www.loganfranken.com/blog/1375/there-is-no-open-source-higher-education-ecosystem/">2016 HighEd Web West</a>,
<a href="https://www.loganfranken.com/blog/1460/the-stories-our-systems-tell/">2016 HighEd Web</a>,
<a href="https://www.loganfranken.com/blog/397/uccsc-talks/">UCCSC</a>, and
