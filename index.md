# Hello!

My name is **Logan Franken**.

I'm a **senior engineering lead**. I live in Brooklyn.

I love **making code work for people**. I work as a full-stack
engineer at **[Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/)**, helping people get jobs.

**I also make indie games.** So far, I've released two full games:
**<a href="https://loganfranken.itch.io/blackjack">Blackjack</a>**
and **<a href="https://loganfranken.itch.io/dew-drop-swap">Dew Drop Swap</a>**, 
both games exploring ideas about autonomy and control.

My e-mail is [loganfranken@gmail.com](mailto:loganfranken@gmail.com).
I'm on [itch.io](https://loganfranken.itch.io/),
[GitHub](https://github.com/loganfranken), and
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/loganfranken/).
